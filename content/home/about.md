# Bio

I work at the intersection of urbanization patterns, local energy policy, and equity. In my research, I seek to understand the motivations, intentions and plans of multiple actors endowed with limited capabilities, imperfect foresight and distributed authority, in urban settings. Lately, I have been studying these issues in the context of local energy planning. I routinely use high cadence, large geospatial and temporal datasets and novel quantitative methods in my research. I am also a planning theorist, specialising in organisational decision-making, institutional restructuring and the role of plans. In addition to my faculty appointments in the City & Regional Planning and Energy Environment and Energy program at UNC, I am a faculty research fellow at [Center for Community Capital](www.comunitycapital.unc.edu) and faculty fellow at the [Insitute for the Enviroment](ie.unc.edu) and [Center for Urban and Regional Studies](curs.unc.edu).
