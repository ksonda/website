abstract = "To date, most planners have focussed on energy consumption. They argue that compact housing and urban patterns reduce both household and transportation energy use and should be promoted to combat a variety of ills, including energy import dependency and climate change. However, planners also have a strong role to play in energy production, particularly with the increasing adoption of renewable forms of energy. Planners will play an integral part in harmonising local land use regulations and policies that will either promote or hinder these technologies. In this paper, we survey the literature and point to environmental and other land use issues that are pertinent to different types of centralised, distributed, conventional and renewable energy production."
