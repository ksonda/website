abstract = "Because these energy expenditures are fairly inelastic, their effects on low- income households may be significant, due to the po tential for energy consumption to displace other types of consumption when energy prices rise. This is particularly true for transportation energy consumption. We test the hypothesis that low and moderate income residents are less likely default, when they are located in more accessible places and find that regional accessibility has almost no effect on risk s of default, but local job diversity has moderate mitigating effect.
