abstract = "U.S. regulations require offsets for aquatic ecosystems damaged during land development, often through restoration of alternative resources. What effect does large scale wetland and stream restoration have on surrounding land values? Restoration effects on real estate values have substantial implications for protecting resources, increasing tax base, and improving environmental policies. Our analysis focuses on the three county Raleigh---Durham--Chapel Hill, North Carolina region, which has experienced rapid development and extensive aquatic ecological restoration (through the state's Ecosystem Enhancement Program [EEP]). Since restoration sites are not randomly distributed across space, we used a genetic algorithm to match parcels near restoration sites with comparable control parcels. Similar to propensity score analysis, this technique facilitates statistical comparison and isolates the effects of restoration sites on surrounding real estate values. Compared to parcels not proximate to any aquatic resources, we found that, 1) natural aquatic systems steadily and significantly increase parcel values up to 0.75 miles away, and 2) parcels < 0.5 mi from EEP restoration sites have significantly lower sale prices, while 3) parcels > 0.5 mi from EEP sites gain substantial amenity value. When we control for intervening water bodies (e.g. unrestored streams and wetlands), we find a similar inflection point whereby parcels < 0.5 mi from EEP sites exhibit lower values, and sites 0.5-- 0.75 mi away exhibit increased values. Our work points to the need for higher public visibility of aquatic ecosystem restoration programs and increased public information about their value."
