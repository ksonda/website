abstract = "Sprawling urbanisation has been the hallmark of development in United States. This study intends to provide a comprehensive overview of the changing urban landscape pat- terns between 2001 and 2006. Using the land cover data from US Geological Survey for these two years, I characterise the landscape metrics for each county in the continental United States. The changes in these metrics are correlated with the drivers of urbani- sation including socioeconomic variables. Uneven and heterogeneous patterns of growth in a country this large are not surprising. However, the metrics reveal that while urban counties are becoming less fragmented, some rural counties in South and Western United States are experiencing significant leapfrog development."
