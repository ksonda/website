# Requirements

I strongly recommend [R](http://r-project.org), [Rstudio](http://rstudio.com) and [Github](http://github.com). I choose the Github pages to host the website and am using blogdown  based on Hugo. See [Alison Presmanes Hill's post](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) for detailed introduction to creating a blogdown site. Or [Amber Thomas' post](http://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/).  I stole most of the material for this post from their posts, mostly to teach myself how to create a blog and provide me with a template for future blogs.

# Additional Resources

Before you start, I recommend reading the following:

* [`blogdown`: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas
* [Making a Website Using `blogdown`, Hugo, and GitHub pages](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/) also by Amber Thomas
* [Getting Started with `blogdown`](https://www.znmeb.mobi/2017/05/12/getting-started-with-blogdown/) by M. Edward (Ed) Borasky



# In RStudio 

1. Install `blogdown` from your RStudio console. You need to install `devtools` first if you don't have it already installed. You could also install hugo from blogdown as following if you skipped the previous step.

```
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
blogdown::install_hugo()
```

2. Use the top menu buttons in RStudio to select `File -> New Project -> Existing Directory`, then browse to the directory on your computer where your website directory should be is and click on the **Create Project** button. This is equivalent to issuing a `blogdown::new_site(theme="XXXX")`command in the Rstudio prompt

4. Now you should be "in" your project in RStudio.  

5. You should see the following sub directories in your website folder. Some of following may not be present due to your system configuration.


![](/post/2018-06-30-using-blogdown_files/Screen Shot 2018-06-30 at 1.53.55 PM.png)

You do most of the edits and changes in the content folder. Running `hugo` command builds the website in the `public` folder. This is the folder that we will upload to the github account to create a website.

 Do not manually add anything to the public folder

If you want to see the preview of the site, look to the viewer pane of Rstudio or use `hugo server -D` in the terminal.

6. Changing themes and other configurations are easy or complicated depending on your theme and your skill level. I recommend not tinkering with the defaults to start with and then gradually changing bits and pieces of the website.


# Creating a blog post in Rmarkdown

Relevant reading:

* [`blogdown` book chapter on RStudio IDE](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html)
* [`blogdown` book chapter on output formats](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html): on .md versus .Rmd posts
* [Additional detail from Amber](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/#adding-a-blog-post-or-portfolio-piece) on adding a blog post

Bottom line:

Use the **New Post** addin. But, you need the console to do this, so you have to stop `blogdown::serve_site` by clicking on the red **Stop** button first. The Addin is a Shiny interface that runs this code in your console: `blogdown:::new_post_addin()`. So, your console needs to be unblocked for it to run. You also need to be "in" your RStudio project or it won't work.

## Draft posts

Relevant reading:

* [`blogdown` book chapter on building a website for local preview](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/local-preview.html)

Whether you do a markdown or R Markdown post (see below), you should know that in the YAML front matter of your new file, you can add `draft: TRUE` and you will be able to preview your post using `blogdown::serve_site()`, but conveniently your post will not show up on your deployed site until you set it to false. Because this is a function built into Hugo, all posts (draft or not) will still end up in your GitHub repo though.




## New markdown posts

Pick one of 2 methods:

1. Use the **New Post** addin and with the radio button at the bottom select **Format: Markdown** (recommended)
2. Use the console to author a new `.md` post:

```
blogdown::new_post()
blogdown::new_post(rmd = FALSE) # false is the default!
```

Here are the `?new_post` arguments:

```
new_post(title, kind = "default", open = interactive(), 
    author = getOption("blogdown.author"), categories = NULL, 
    tags = NULL, date = Sys.Date(), file = NULL, slug = NULL, 
    subdir = getOption("blogdown.subdir", "post"), 
    rmd = getOption("blogdown.rmd", FALSE))
```

{{% alert note %}}
Remember to use the **Serve Site** addin again so that you can immediately view your changes with every save using *LiveReload*.
{{% /alert %}}

## New RMarkdown posts

Again, you have your choice of one of 2 methods:

1. Use the **New Post** addin and with the radio button at the bottom select **Format: RMarkdown** (recommended)
2. Use the console to author a new `.Rmd` post:

```
blogdown::new_post(rmd = TRUE) # false is the default!
```


After you edit your `.Rmd` post, in addition to saving the changes in your `.Rmd` file, you *must* use `blogdown::serve_site`- this is how the output `html` file needs to be generated.   

{{% alert warning %}}
Do *not* knit your `.Rmd` posts- use `blogdown::serve_site` instead. If you happen to hit the knit button, just **Serve Site** again to rewrite the `.html` file.
{{% /alert %}}

Ultimately, your [YAML front matter looks something like this](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html#output-format); note that some but not all features of `rmarkdown::html_document` [are supported in `blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html#fn15):

```

title: "My Awesome Post"
author: "John Doe"
date: "2017-02-14"
output:
  blogdown::html_page:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 1
    number_sections: true
    fig_width: 6
---
```



{{% alert note %}}
Remember to use the **Serve Site** addin again so that you can immediately view your changes with every save using *LiveReload* and your `.html` file is properly output.
{{% /alert %}}



## Adding images to a post

If you want to include an image that is not a figure created from an R chunk, the [recommended method](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/45) is to: 

1. Add the image to your `/static/img/` folder, then 
2. Reference the image using the relative file path as follows:

```
![my-image](/img/my-image.png)
```


# GitHub Account
First you need to create a [Github](www.github.com) account. This will also be the website name. 

- Create a new repository called `yourusername.github.io.` and make it public.

![](/post/2018-06-30-using-blogdown_files/newrepo.png){width=200px height=200px}


- Using terminal go to `website\public` using `cd` and issue the following commands

```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.git.io
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git push -u origin master

```

4. The first two commands will only need to be issued once. The last three commands suitably modified will update `yourusername.github.io`

That is all there is to it. If you want to add more posts, keep adding a new post page in `R markdown`, create a static html page and add to the github repo to update your website.

Happy blogging.
